Rails Templates
===============

To use:

  rails new &lt;appnamme&gt; --template=https://github.com/sampierson/rails-templates/raw/master/&lt;template&gt;.rb

Note: there is a but in Rails versions < 3.0.4 that will not allow you to use https:// addresses for templates.
So to use this, just use curl to download it and run it from your local disk.
